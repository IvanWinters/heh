Please provide a short description of your programming progress

[I created a bunch of Jlabels and Jubttons and jpanels to create a working GUI that is interactive. GWackClientGUI extends Jfram ad impliments ITem Listener to see the window actions GWackChannel is where i extend KeyListeneer where it detects where i close and opent he window. IN the client i do call on a couple of funcitons in channel like send buttonmsg and disconnect. so my client is a child of GWack Channel]
